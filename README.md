## INTRODUCTION

As the world becomes increasingly digital, ensuring online safety and security is vital for national well-being. Bangladesh is embracing digital technology rapidly, with more people and businesses relying on the internet for communication, commerce, and public services. However, this progress brings growing threats such as cybercrime, data breaches, and online fraud.

Although initiatives like the Digital Security Act 2018 have been introduced, there remain significant gaps in personal data protection, digital system security, and safe online experiences. Reforming and modernizing cyber laws is essential to building a safer digital future.

This report reviews Bangladesh’s current cyber legislation and draws insights from the world's five happiest countries—Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, and the Netherlands—recognized for their robust digital governance. By adopting global best practices, Bangladesh can enhance its digital infrastructure, promote responsible online behavior, and progress towards a safer, inclusive, and happier digital nation.

## EXISTING CYBER LAWS OF BANGLADESH

### Primary Laws

- **ICT Act, 2006**: The first law targeting cybercrimes such as hacking and online fraud. Section 57 was controversial for suppressing freedom of expression and was later repealed.

- **Cyber Security Act, 2023**: Replaced the Digital Security Act with reduced penalties and more balanced provisions. However, it still lacks clarity and strong data protection measures.
- **Cyber Security Ordinance, 2025 (Latest)**: Recognizes internet access as a basic right. Introduces protections against online abuse and AI-related crimes. Allows faster removal of harmful content via court orders.

### Data Protection Laws (Draft Stage)

- **Informed Consent**
- **Rights to Access, Correct, or Delete Data**
- **Data Minimization**
